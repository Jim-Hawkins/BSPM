# BSPM - Blazingly Simple Password Manager

A handful utility for your tons of passwords which you'd better not write down
on a post-it.

This tool is based on a college project with similar backend and it is
currently mutating to the desired idea.

In order to run it, navigate to the project's root directory and activate the
virtual environment to provide the system with the necessary libraries.

```bash
souce pwdmanager_ven/bin/activate
python main.py
```

Don't worry, none of your computer settings are changed. To exit from the
virtual environment, just run

```bash
deactivate
```

or close the terminal.
